# Installing the Mod

- Download the latest release version from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/ogjex/d2neverdies), or simply copy the /data folder in the repository.
- Using the D2R launch parameters `-mod` and `-txt`.  
- Create a new folder called `d2nd.mpq` in your D2R install location, inside the mods folder, inside `d2nd` (like `D2R/mods/d2nd/d2nd.mpq`).
- Place the `modinfo.json` file and the folder `data/` from this repository into `mods/d2nd/d2nd.mpq/`.  
- Start `D2R.exe - Shortcut` with the launch options `-mod d2nd -txt` (NOT `-direct -txt`).  
- Replace the all `.d2i` files in your `Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\d2nd\` folder with the `SharedStashSoftCoreV2.d2i` and `SharedStashHardCoreV2.d2i` from the `save` folder of the downloaded repository

NOTE: Saved characters for this mod will be in your `Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\d2nd\` folder, not the default `Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\` folder.
