# Known Bugs

- When launching the mod, the game will sometimes crash once, twice or three times on launch after splash before running fine. Please just relaunch the game until it works.
- Skill tabs graphics still show dependency arrows (will be fixed in a later patch)
- PDR on defiance aura does not work on allies (from Desert Merc)
- Inventory grid is slightly off-center in Controller
