Big thanks to the Phrozen Keep community! 

A special thanks to Bonesy for his patience, help, and guidance with the Bidding system as well as the Mercenary Equip system.

A very special thanks to Senpaisomething for launching Project Diablo 2, which started this whole modding craze. PD2 was the reason the D2ND team found eachother and why this project was started in the first place.
