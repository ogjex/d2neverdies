Our mod has got you covered! We've implemented much-needed Quality of Life changes that will make your gameplay smoother and more enjoyable. Whether you're a casual gamer with limited time or a hardcore player who loves to create multiple characters and builds, our mod is balanced to suit your needs. We've buffed underused skills and item types, so you can try out new builds and play styles. Plus, you'll find rare items that will help you reach endgame, and you can even forge unique items and set items as you progress. Beware though, they come at a cost when not found yourself! Get ready for an exciting and rewarding journey through Diablo 2 Resurrected with our mod! Get ready for an ecosystem of loot Get ready to dive into an exciting world of loot with our mod's ecosystem of loot! We understand that one of the most thrilling aspects of D2 is the rush of finding more and better loot. That's why we've drastically improved drop chances for single-player mode. You'll find enough unique items to keep things interesting, but not so much that you'll be overwhelmed with loot that fills up your screen. And when it comes to loot, balance is key. Our mod is designed with Hardcore play in mind, though Softcore players can still have a blast. We've introduced higher difficulties in both Nightmare and Hell, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to put your gear to the test. While losing a character to a random death is never fun, you can quickly rebuild with mid-level gear and jump right back into the action. Leveling and trying new builds Leveling up and experimenting with new builds has never been more thrilling! Our mod has increased Normal and Nightmare difficulties in a variety of ways, adding more loot and more risks. All modes feature higher resistance penalties, doubled monster density, and tripled unique monster spawns. Enhancing items with risks But that's not all - we've also enhanced items with risks, adding multiple possibilities to attain better items. You can reroll unique items with divination orbs and essence charges, forge your own uniques and set items at a cost and with a chance of receiving penalty stats, or even corrupt your items with crafting corruptions or combat corruptions, with the risk of bricking your item into a rare item. Making room for loot and configuring the character And finally, we've made room for loot and configuring the character easier by introducing unique, character-specific \"Valor\" charms, which can be upgraded as you go by finding \"Biddings\". These scrolls of magical powers empower your character as you level up, adding new item-granted powers and skill trees. But be warned - you can't remove powers from a Valor charm, so you'll have to make some tough choices as you move forward in your quest. Get ready to level up and experiment with new builds like never before with our exciting mod!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#diablo-2-never-dies-d2nd","text":"A Diablo II Resurrected Mod Looking for a way to level up your Diablo 2 Resurrected experience?

A: Indeed. Especially their item balancing has been a big source of inspiration that enables many items to be a lot better. We have used many of the same attributes to bring the PD2 experience to Single Player D2R. There are also core areas of PD2 that simply do not work with Single Player D2R or that we directly disagree with. Thanks, Senpaisomething and PD2 team! Q: It's very difficult once you reach Hell! A: We know. It's partly on purpose because we currently do not have end game content as part of the mod right now. Hell difficulty is considered end game right now. We have also limited the number of buffs (through a max of 60 infusion points) that can given to the character, meaning that you will have to make some tradeoffs in damage vs defense. For Softcore players this will not make a huge difference, but for Harcore players it will be scary. And that's part of the fun. Q: When will you add Terror Zones? A: As soon as Blizzard enables it in Single Player. Q: Will you be updating the game along the Blizzard Ladder patches? A: Yes. We have to. You will probably experience that the mod will be in a need of a patch everytime Blizzard updates the game, as they have a tendency to add new features that require integration. We continuously keep a look out for new balance changes introduced and listen to the community in terms of how to take advantage of them in D2ND as well. Q: Can you add X feature? A: Maybe. If it is possible within the limitations of soft modding, and if it makes sense Q: How many of you are developing this mod? A: The mod was originally envisioned as a joint project between JeX, Swoosh, and Thrugg_aka_Trogg. Thrugg_aka_Trogg provided a lot of developer support, troubleshooting and laid the infrastructure foundation. Swoosh has laid out and pitched a lot of the features of corruptions, treasureclass drops, and the Valor charm concept. JeX has produced the artwork, discord and webserver, tied most of the features together, finetuned and balanced gameplay through playthroughs over the past two years. So many nights have been spent discussing and outlining automagic attributes, bidding functionality, new crafting mechanics and QoL updates. Since 2022, JeX has been working solo and is far from done! As the title of the project goes: Diablo 2 Never Dies.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"This FAQ will be continuously updated","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#q-looks-like-you-have-been-inspired-a-lot-by-project-diablo-2","text":"A: Indeed.
