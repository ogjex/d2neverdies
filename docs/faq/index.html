    <h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p>This FAQ will be continuously updated </p>
<h3 id="q-looks-like-you-have-been-inspired-a-lot-by-project-diablo-2">Q: looks like you have been inspired a lot by Project Diablo 2?</h3>
<p>A: Indeed. Especially their item balancing has been a big source of inspiration that enables many items to be a lot better. We have used many of the same attributes to bring the PD2 experience to Single Player D2R. There are also core areas of PD2 that simply do not work with Single Player D2R or that we directly disagree with. Thanks, Senpaisomething and PD2 team!</p>
<h3 id="q-its-very-difficult-once-you-reach-hell">Q: It's very difficult once you reach Hell!</h3>
<p>A: We know. It's partly on purpose because we currently do not have end game content as part of the mod right now. Hell difficulty is considered end game right now. 
We have also limited the number of buffs (through a max of 60 infusion points) that can given to the character, meaning that you will have to make some tradeoffs in damage vs defense. For Softcore players this will not make a huge difference, but for Harcore players it will be scary. And that's part of the fun.</p>
<h3 id="q-when-will-you-add-terror-zones">Q: When will you add Terror Zones?</h3>
<p>A: As soon as Blizzard enables it in Single Player.</p>
<h3 id="q-will-you-be-updating-the-game-along-the-blizzard-ladder-patches">Q: Will you be updating the game along the Blizzard Ladder patches?</h3>
<p>A: Yes. We have to. You will probably experience that the mod will be in a need of a patch everytime Blizzard updates the game, as they have a tendency to add new features that require integration. We continuously keep a look out for new balance changes introduced and listen to the community in terms of how to take advantage of them in D2ND as well.</p>
<h3 id="q-can-you-add-x-feature">Q: Can you add X feature?</h3>
<p>A: Maybe. If it is possible within the limitations of soft modding, and if it makes sense</p>
<h3 id="q-how-many-of-you-are-developing-this-mod">Q: How many of you are developing this mod?</h3>
<p>A: The mod was originally envisioned as a joint project between JeX, Swoosh, and Thrugg_aka_Trogg. Thrugg_aka_Trogg provided a lot of developer support, troubleshooting and laid the infrastructure foundation. Swoosh has laid out and pitched a lot of the features of corruptions, treasureclass drops, and the Valor charm concept. JeX has produced the artwork, discord and webserver, tied most of the features together, finetuned and balanced gameplay through playthroughs over the past two years. So many nights have been spent discussing and outlining automagic attributes, bidding functionality, new crafting mechanics and QoL updates. Since 2022, JeX has been working solo and is far from done! As the title of the project goes: Diablo 2 Never Dies.</p>
